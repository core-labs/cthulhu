# sample

This directory holds a sample generated fixture that was created with the
following command:

```
cthulhu --instances 3 --docker-container hello-world
```

Use this sample to demystify what cthulhu is doing under the hood. Note, the
sample isn't going to be actually runnable because you might not have docker
installed and might not have a hello-world docker image in your local docker
repository.
